# Harveston Climate Prediction üåæüå¶Ô∏è

## Overview
Harveston's climate is shifting unpredictably, affecting agriculture and food security. This project aims to develop time series forecasting models to predict five critical environmental variables:
- Average Temperature (¬∞C)
- Radiation (W/m¬≤)
- Rain Amount (mm)
- Wind Speed (km/h)
- Wind Direction (¬∞)

## Models Used
### 1. RandomForestRegressor ([Code 1](code%201.py))
- Uses **Random Forest**, an ensemble learning model that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions.
- Handles feature engineering, categorical encoding, and missing data preprocessing.

### 2. LightGBM ([Code 2](code%202.py))
- Implements **LightGBM**, an optimized **ensemble gradient boosting model** that builds trees sequentially to improve predictions.
- Uses boosting techniques for efficient learning and high performance.
- Performs hyperparameter tuning and feature extraction.

### 3. XGBoost ([Code 3](code%203.py))
- Uses **XGBoost**, another powerful **ensemble gradient boosting model** known for efficiency and regularization.
- Applies gradient boosting with optimized tree-building techniques.
- Handles categorical encoding, missing values, and feature engineering.

### 4. LSTM ([Code 4](code%204.py))
- Uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed for sequential data processing.
- Employs memory cells to capture long-term dependencies and temporal patterns in data.
- Trains the model with early stopping, batch processing, and validation to optimize performance.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains historical environmental records from different kingdoms in Harveston.
- The test dataset includes `ID`, `Year`, `Month`, `Day`, and `kingdom`, requiring predictions for the five target variables.

## Evaluation Metric
Predictions are evaluated using **Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (sMAPE)**:

$$sMAPE = \frac{100\%}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{|y_{true,i} - y_{pred,i}|}{(|y_{true,i}| + |y_{pred,i}|)/2}$$

The final score is the average sMAPE across all target columns.
